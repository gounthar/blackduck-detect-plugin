# Overview
Black Duck Detect for Jenkins simplifies running Detect in your Jenkins builds.

Note: The Synopsys Software Integrity Group is now Black DuckÂ®. If you are an existing Detect user, automatic upgrade to the latest plugin version will not resolve pipeline script configuration. 
Pipeline Groovy Scripts will have to be updated to reflect the changes [described here] (
https://documentation.blackduck.com/bundle/detect/page/integrations/jenkinsplugin/jenkinspipelinejob.html).
